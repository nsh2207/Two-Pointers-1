I used 2 pointer approach for this. I sorted the array and used first pointer to fix the first element of the triad, 
then in the remaining suffix sub array, beyond the fixed element, I used 2 pointers to find the remaining pair of elements,
which make up the negation of the first element, so that the sum of the obtained triplet is 0.
